# Python Machine Learning and C++
Applying a machine learning algorithm to biological datasets and writing basic C++ functions, as part of assessed coursework for a module in Advanced Programming.

*puffins.ipynb* - Jupyter Notebook file, implementing a classifer for puffin species then assessing the effectiveness of this classifier (kNN)

*functions.cpp* - Basic functions written in C++ within UNIX
- Code can be compiled and run with UNIX with the following:
  - `g++ functions.cpp -o functions`
